# BlockchainBasics

## Characteristics of the blockchain
- Immutable
- Append-only
- Ordered
- Time-stamped
- Open and transparent
- Secure
- Eventually consistent

## Generic application patterns
- Proof of existence
- Proof of nonexistence
- Proof of time
- Proof of order
- Proof of identity
- Proof of ownership
- Proof of authorship


## Analyzing blockchain applications

1) What kind of blockchain is used?
2) Are the requirements for using the blockchain fulfilled?
3) What is the added value of using a distributed peer-to-peer system?
4) What is the application idea?
5) What is the business case?
6) How are peers compensated for contributing resources to the system?

### 1) What kind of blockchain is used?
- What kind of blockchain is used(public vs private and permissioned vs permissionless)?
- What rights are restricted?
- What groups of nodes have which rights?
- Why has this specific type of blockchain been used?
- Who decides which rights are given to what group of nodes?
- Who makes and enforces the rules regarding granting or refusing reading or writing access to the system?
- Who runs the on-boarding process?
- Are there any privacy or scalability concerns in the specific solution tht could justify the restruction of certain rights?

### 2) Are the requirements for using the blockchain fulfilled?
- What is the architecture of the system?
- What are the system components and how are they connected with one another?
- Is the system purely distributed or is there a central component whose failure can bring down the whole system?
- How do new nodes join the system?
- Can everyone join the system and start to contribute computational resources?
- is there any kind of on-boarding process, due diligence process, or upfront security checking of new nodes that may establish a central element of control?
- Do all nodes have identical roles and rights in the system or do the nodes differ with respect to their rights to read or write data?

### 3) What is the added value of using the purely peer-to-peer system?
- Why was the system implemented as a purely distributed peer-to-peer system in the first place?
- What are the alternatives?
- What are the advantages of utilizing a purely distributed peer-to-peer architecture over the alternatives and what are the disadvantages?
- What is the added value of using a distributed peer-to-peer architecture?
- Do the advantages of the peer-to-peer architecture outweigh the disadvantages?

### 4) What is the application idea?
- What is the purpose of the application in the first place?
- What is the major problem domain of the system?
- Can the system be associated with specific industries or
sectors and if yes what are they?
- What kind of service does the system offer to its users?
- What is the added value of using the system?
- What kind of generic blockchain use pattern does the
system utilize?
- Are there any issues with the legal acceptance of the
blockchain in the particular application area?
- What kinds of data are stored in the blockchain?
- What kinds of operations or transactions can be done?
- What kinds of security features are utilized?
- How do these aspects relate to the application idea of
the system?

### 5) What is the business case?
- What are the costs of purchasing or using the software?
- What are the fixed and variable costs of running or using
the software?
- Who covers what costs?
- What license model is used?
- Who receives profits or who has to cover losses?

### 6) How Are Peers Compensated for Contributing Resources to the System and Maintaining Integrity?
- What are the rules for compensating peers?
- Do the compensation rules together with the game
theoretic aspects of the blockchain ensure and reward
honesty to those who contribute to the system?
- What are the fees for having actions or transactions
verified and executed by the system?
- What instrument of payment is used to pay transaction
fees?
- What instrument of payment is used to compensate the
peers for verifying and writing data in the blockchain?
